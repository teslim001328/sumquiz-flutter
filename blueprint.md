# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that provides study tools for students. It uses Firebase for authentication and generative AI features.

## Current Status

The application is now in a stable state. I have fixed the issues related to the AI service and summary generation.

### Fixes

*   **`ai_service.dart`**: I've updated the `AIService` to use the latest `firebase_ai` package, ensuring that it correctly initializes and uses the Gemini models. I've also updated the `generateSummary` method to return a JSON-formatted error, which is more robust.
*   **`summary_screen.dart`**: I've updated the `SummaryScreen` to correctly parse the JSON response from the `AIService` and to handle the new `title`, `tags`, and `content` fields. I've also updated the `_saveToLibrary` method to correctly create the `Summary` object with the `title` and `tags`.
*   **`firestore_service.dart`**: I've updated the `FirestoreService` to correctly handle the `addSummary` and `updateSummary` methods, ensuring that the correct data is saved to Firestore and the local database.

## Plan

The application is now in a good state. I will continue to monitor for any issues and will work to improve the application based on your feedback.
