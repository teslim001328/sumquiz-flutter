# Project Blueprint: V2 - Image Analysis with Gemini

## Overview
This version will add a feature to analyze images using Gemini. The user will be able to pick an image, which will be uploaded to Firebase Storage. Gemini will then generate a description of the image, which will be displayed in the app.

## V2 Plan
1.  **Add Dependencies:** Install `image_picker`, `firebase_storage`, and `firebase_ai`.
2.  **Update UI:** 
    *   Add a button to pick an image.
    *   Display the selected image.
    *   Display the Gemini-generated description.
    *   Show a loading indicator during processing.
3.  **Implement Logic:** 
    *   Pick an image using `image_picker`.
    *   Upload the image to Firebase Storage.
    *   Call Gemini with the image URL.
4.  **Platform Configuration:** Configure iOS (`Info.plist`) for photo library access.
5.  **Display Results:** Show the generated text in the UI.
